# Nexus Task Project

This project is a complete implementation of student registration, login, and feedback systems using the MVC structure.

## Features

- **Student Registration**: Allows students to register by filling in their details, including name, course, semester, email, and password.
- **Student Login**: Provides a login interface where students can securely log in using their credentials.
- **Feedback System**: Once logged in, students can submit feedback. The feedback is stored in the database for future reference.

## MVC Structure

The project is structured following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns:

- **Model**: Manages the data and database interactions.
- **View**: Handles the display of data and user interfaces.
- **Controller**: Coordinates between the Model and View, processing input and executing actions.

## Database

The database required for this project is included in the `database` folder. It contains all the necessary tables and initial data to get the system up and running.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prakashcareer/nexus_project.git
